# Tailwind CSS Basics

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide to **Tailwind CSS v4**, a utility-first CSS framework that lets you rapidly build modern, responsive user interfaces.

---

## What Is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a **utility-first framework**, which means instead of writing custom CSS classes for every component, you style elements directly in your markup using small, purpose-driven utility classes.

This approach allows you to:

- Build faster with fewer lines of CSS.
- Easily maintain consistent design patterns.
- Leverage responsive and dark-mode utilities out of the box.

## Why Use Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS offers many advantages:

- **Utility-First** – Compose designs using prebuilt classes.  
- **Highly Customizable** – Configure your design system via `tailwind.config.js`.  
- **Responsive by Default** – Use breakpoints like `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `2xl`.  
- **Dark Mode Support** – Use classes like `dark:bg-gray-900` or `dark:prose-invert`.  
- **Performance-Focused** – Only generate CSS you actually use.  
- **Developer Experience** – Works seamlessly with React, Next.js, MDX, and editor tooling.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Utility Classes

Instead of writing traditional CSS:

```html
<!-- Traditional CSS -->
<div class="card">
  <p class="title">Hello World</p>
</div>

<style>
  .card { padding: 1rem; background-color: #f3f4f6; }
  .title { font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; }
</style>

<!-- Tailwind CSS -->
<div class="p-4 bg-gray-100">
  <p class="text-xl font-semibold">Hello World</p>
</div>
