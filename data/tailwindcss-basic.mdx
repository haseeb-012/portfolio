# Modern Tailwind CSS Guide (v4)

Tailwind CSS v4 brings a refined developer experience with smarter defaults, faster builds, and a more expressive utility system. If you're starting fresh or upgrading, this short guide gives you the essential updates you need.

---

## Utility-First Styling

Tailwind’s core idea remains simple: apply small, meaningful classes directly in your markup.

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-xl shadow">
  Welcome to Tailwind v4 🎉
</div>
```
---  


##  Enhanced Responsive System

Tailwind's breakpoints are unchanged, but responsiveness is smoother thanks to the new build engine.

<p class="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
  Resize to see responsive text!
</p>

Breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl.

## Modern Layout Utilities

Flexbox

<div class="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-gray-100 rounded-xl">
  <span>Item A</span>
  <span>Item B</span>
  <span>Item C</span>
</div>

Grid

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <div class="bg-blue-300 p-3 rounded">1</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-400 p-3 rounded">2</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-3 rounded text-white">3</div>
</div>

---  


## Interaction States

<button class="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg">
  Hover Me
</button>

Tailwind now auto-manages CSS layers, so hover/focus styles stay lightweight.
